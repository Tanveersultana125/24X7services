 * What people scored a service, and how many of them did.

 * Both or neither, everywhere it appears. 4.9 from three people and 4.9 from
 * three thousand are not the same claim, and a star with a bare number beside
 * it invites a reader to assume the second — so a catalog row that carries
 * only one of the two draws no score at all. That rule lives here, in the
 * component, rather than in each of the four screens that show one.
 *
 * `full` is for a card with a line to spare; `compact` for a rail card or a
 * grid tile, where "reviews" is a word the reader can supply themselves and
 * the space is better spent on the name.
