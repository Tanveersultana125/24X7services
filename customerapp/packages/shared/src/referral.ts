 * paid until the person they brought in has had a job finished. Not signed up,
 * not booked — finished. Every other moment is one somebody can manufacture
 * from a second phone number, and a referral scheme that pays on sign-up is a
 * sign-up scheme.
 *
 * Both sides are paid at that same moment, which also settles the question of
 * what the new customer gets: credits on their balance, not a discount on the
 * booking that earns them. A discount at checkout would have to survive
 * cancellation, partial approval and a refund; credits after the fact do not.
