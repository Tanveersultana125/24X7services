/**
 * Everything this app holds about one customer, in one file they can keep.
 *
 * It is assembled on the customer's own device out of reads they are already
 * allowed to make — the rules grant an owner their profile, addresses, saved
 * appliances, bookings, invoices, warranties, reviews, notifications, wallet
 * ledger, plans, membership, gift cards and referral record, and grant nobody
 * anything else. So there is no export job, no email with a link in it, and
 * nothing sitting in a bucket waiting to be found: the customer presses a
 * button and the file is in their downloads.
 *
 * What is deliberately not in it: anything about anyone else. A booking's
 * technician appears as the name and rating the customer was shown, which is
 * what they already saw, and never as a phone number or an employee record.
 *
 * It is a plain JSON file rather than a PDF because this is a copy of records,
 * not a report — a customer moving to another service, or checking what we
 * have, wants the fields.
