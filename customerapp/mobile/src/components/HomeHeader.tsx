 * under it is sticky, so it rides up with the finger and then stays pinned at
 * the top. Nothing waits for a scroll threshold — the header moves exactly as
 * far as the page does, which is what makes it feel smooth.
 *
 * `HomeHeader` renders the three stacked, for parity with the web export.
 * Home itself places them apart — the strip as the screen's header, the
 * location row and the search as children of its scroll view, the search one
 * of the view's sticky headers — because a sticky child has to be a direct
 * child of the scroll view, and a wrapper would pin only for its own height.
