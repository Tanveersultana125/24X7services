/**
 * The frame every step of the booking flow sits in, and the gate in front of it.
 *
 * Three things can be wrong when a screen loads, and all three are the same
 * kind of wrong — the customer is somewhere the draft does not support yet:
 *
 *   - Nothing has been chosen to book. Back to the service list.
 *   - An earlier step is unfilled, because this URL was opened directly or a
 *     stale draft was dropped. Back to the first thing missing.
 *   - The step needs an account and there is not one. To sign-in, with where
 *     to return afterwards.
 *
 * Doing this once means no step screen has to remember it, and adding a step is
 * a row in BOOKING_STEPS rather than a set of redirects to get right.
 *
 * Nothing renders until the draft and the auth state have both been read.
 * Deciding on either before it is known sends a signed-in customer with a full
 * draft back to the beginning of the flow.
