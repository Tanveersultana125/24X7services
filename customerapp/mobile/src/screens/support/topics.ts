/**
 * Everything the support inbox actually fills up with, sorted into the six
 * things people arrive asking about.
 *
 * Every answer here is a statement about how this app behaves, checked against
 * the code that does it — the visit fee and approval flow in `createBooking`
 * and `respondToRepairRequest`, the cancellation figures in the business
 * config, the balance's limits in `shared/wallet.ts`, the membership's in
 * `shared/plans.ts`. A help centre that drifts from the product is worse than
 * none, because it is believed.
 *
 * Kept as data rather than as pages so there is one place to correct when one
 * of these stops being true, and so the topic list and the answers cannot fall
 * out of step.

        a: 'Pick the appliance, tell us what it is doing, choose a time window and an address. You pay the visit fee to confirm, or settle after the service where that is offered. The whole thing is nine steps and you can go back at any of them.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How much will the repair cost?',
        a: 'You pay the visit fee to book. Your technician inspects the appliance and quotes anything beyond that, itemised — part and labour separately — and nothing is charged or started until you approve it on the booking.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the time window?',
        a: 'A two-hour window, not a fixed minute. You get a notification when your technician is on the way, and you can watch them approach on the booking once they set off.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How do I know the person at my door is from you?',

      },
      {
        q: 'What does cancelling cost?',
        a: 'Cancelling well before your slot is free. Closer to it a small fee applies, and the exact figure is shown on screen before you confirm — never after.',
      },
      {
        q: 'When do I get my money back?',
        a: 'Anything refundable goes back to the card or account it came from. The booking tells you the amount and how many working days it takes, and the same figures are on the invoice.',
      },
      {
        q: 'My technician has not arrived. What now?',

        q: 'Do you store my card?',

      {
        q: 'What is my 24X7 balance?',
        a: 'Two things in one number: credits we gave you — for a visit we reached late, a job we had to cancel, a referral or a gift card — and money you added yourself. Both come off your next bill, and the activity list says which is which on every line.',

        q: 'Can I withdraw my balance or send it to someone?',
        a: 'It can only be spent on 24X7 services, on your own account — it cannot be transferred or taken as cash. Money you added yourself is refundable on request: ask support and it goes back the way it came.',

        q: 'What is the difference between a plan and a membership?',
        a: 'A plan is bought against appliances: a set number of services on a named fridge or washing machine, for a year. A membership is bought against your account and changes the price of everything — the visit fee goes and 10% comes off repairs you approve.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How is a plan visit used up?',
        a: 'When a job is finished, not when it is booked. A booking you cancel has cost you nothing. The plan screen shows visits left and days left, because those are the two ways a plan ends.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Does 24X7 Plus renew on its own?',
        a: 'No, and there is no switch for it. It runs out and you buy it again if you want it. Buying while it is still live adds to what is left rather than starting again.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What if my membership runs out between booking and the visit?',

      },
      {
        q: 'How long does it last?',
        a: 'It depends on the service, and the exact dates are on the warranty itself under Profile, Warranties. The list is ordered by what runs out first.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How do I claim it?',

        q: 'Can I change my mobile number?',
        a: 'Not from inside the app. The number is the account — it is how your bookings are found and how a technician reaches you on the day — so changing it is a support conversation.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Who sees my address?',
        a: 'The technician assigned to your booking, and only for that booking. A booking keeps its own copy of the address, so editing or deleting a saved address later does not rewrite where a past job happened.',
