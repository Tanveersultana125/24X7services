/**
 * One appliance: what we do to it, what usually goes wrong with it, and which
 * brands we take.
 *
 * The screen is built the way the big marketplaces build theirs, because that
 * shape is what a customer already knows how to read: the appliance and its
 * cheapest visit fee at the top, a row of the services on it that jumps down
 * the page, then those services priced one per row, and a bar at the bottom
 * that books the common one without scrolling back up. The rest of the page —
 * the four steps, the promises, the brands, the warranty note — is the same
 * content the services screen carries, from the same components, so a customer
 * who arrived here from a shared link is told the same things in the same
 * order as one who browsed in.
 *
 * A second parameter, `s`, names the service to open at. It is how the sheet
 * on Home hands over: a customer who tapped "Deep clean" lands on the deep
 * clean, not at the top of a page they now have to search.
 *
 * Jumping: the web finds a section by its element id and lets the browser
 * scroll. Here every section reports where it was laid out (`onLayout`), and
 * a jump — from the picture row, the warranty line, the Menu, or `s` on
 * arrival — scrolls the page's own ScrollView to that offset. The group
 * headings are the scroll view's sticky headers, so each stays pinned under
 * the header while its rows scroll past; a jump to a row stops below it.
