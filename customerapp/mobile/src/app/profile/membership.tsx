/**
 * 24X7 Plus: what it does, what it costs, and when it runs out.
 *
 * Every benefit listed here is one the backend actually applies at checkout —
 * the visit fee is waived on the booking and the repair discount comes off the
 * approved total, both recorded on the booking itself so a membership that
 * lapses next week cannot re-price a job booked today. A membership screen
 * whose benefits are honoured by a person reading a spreadsheet is a refund
 * request with a screenshot attached.
 *
 * It does not renew itself, and the screen says so rather than burying it. A
 * subscription that charges without asking needs a mandate, a reminder, a
 * cancellation flow and somewhere to argue about the charge; until all four
 * exist, this lapses and the customer buys it again.
