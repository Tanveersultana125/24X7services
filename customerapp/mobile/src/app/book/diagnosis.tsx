/**
 * What might be wrong, and what it is not.
 *
 * This is a lookup against the catalog, not a diagnosis and not a model. The
 * wording says so in three places and never softens: "possible causes", "your
 * expert will confirm", and no price anywhere on the screen. A number beside a
 * cause would read as a quote for a repair nobody has looked at yet, and a
 * customer who arrives at the review screen expecting that figure has been
 * misled by this one.
 *
 * What is shown is recorded on the booking. If a customer later says they were
 * told it was the compressor, the record is of what this screen actually put in
 * front of them.
