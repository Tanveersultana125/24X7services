/**
 * The GST invoice for a finished job.
 *
 * Read from the invoice document, which the completion trigger wrote with the
 * seller details copied into it. Nothing on this screen reads the business
 * config — an invoice has to keep saying what it said on the day it was issued,
 * and a screen that re-read the config would silently reissue every past
 * invoice under a new address.
 *
 * The PDF is the same document rendered as a file, for anyone who has to hand
 * it to an accountant. On a phone it is downloaded and handed to the share
 * sheet (save to Files, mail it, WhatsApp it). If the render failed there is no
 * file and the screen says so — and offers the invoice as text instead, which
 * the web's print view covered there.
