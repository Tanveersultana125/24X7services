/**
 * Every booking, in three tabs.
 *
 * The tabs are the three states a customer thinks in: something is coming,
 * something is happening right now, and something is done. They are not the
 * eleven statuses the system tracks — a customer does not care whether a
 * booking is `en_route` or `arrived`, only that someone is on their way.
 *
 * Active leads, because a job in progress is the one thing on this screen that
 * might need an answer in the next ten minutes.
 *
 * Signed out it draws itself rather than bouncing to the login form — but not
 * with the tabs. Three filters over nothing all show the same block, so
 * tapping one does nothing, and a control that does nothing is worse than no
 * control. They come back with the account that has something to filter.
 *
 * What fills the screen instead is what a booking here actually carries: the
 * technician tracked on the way, the invoice, the warranty. Those are facts
 * about this business rather than about one account, they are true before
 * anybody signs in, and they are the answer to the question a signed-out
 * visitor on this screen is really asking — what do I get for booking through
 * the app rather than ringing someone. The same block sits under an empty
 * list for somebody who has signed in and not booked yet, because that screen
 * is just as blank and the answer is just as useful.
 *
 * Sign in leads. Somebody who opened "My bookings" most likely has some; a
 * screen that puts the catalogue first and signing in in the small print is
 * telling a returning customer they are in the wrong place.
 *
 * No back arrow: this is a tab, so there is nowhere behind it to go.
